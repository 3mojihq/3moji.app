3moji is an **upgradeable, composable, interoperable, and adaptable NFT avatar** system on the Solana chain where third-party artists and designers can also create and sell their own merch as NFTs. 

3moji’s upgradation is powered by Meta Blocks, an NFT upgradation protocol. For a detailed overview of the Meta Blocks protocol works, refer to the [protocol guide](https://metablocks.world/guides/protocol) of Meta Blocks. 

The value of a traditional NFT is linked to its traits. The rarer the traits, the higher the rarity and hence, higher the value. However, the combination of traits of a particular NFT is dependent on random chance and can’t be modified or altered for functional or visual modifications. 

3moji takes a different approach wherein the “traits” are treated as composable and tradeable fragments that come together to form an NFT. In such a case, the combination of traits in an NFT are not a function of chance or luck, but rather a product of decisions. 

3moji NFTs start with a ***“base layer”*** where you can configure the basic attributes of your avatar such as the face shape, eye colour, skin colour, ears, nose and eyebrows. THESE BASIC ATTRIBUTES ARE FIXED AND CAN’T BE CHANGED. Base layers are free and non-scare, and hence not valuable. The only exception to the non-scarcity is limited edition base layers, such as Genesis Series, which have special attributes that are otherwise not available, and hence they're valuable. 

Users can then participate in “drops” where you can buy accessories and skills made by 3moji as well as third party artists and designers. 

For example, once you mint your base layer, you can buy a baseball hat for it and upgrade your NFT. However, once you’re bored with the baseball hat, you can sell it and get a beanie for your avatar.
