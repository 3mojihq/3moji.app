## 👩‍🦲 Base Layers

Base Layers is a configurable avatar that you can generate and mint to start off with the 3moji way of life. Currently, the base layer only includes heads, however, it will be extended to full body soon. Holders of current 3moji heads will be able to add and configure a body to their heads once the support for full bodies is out. 

The base layer allows you to customize the following attributes:

* Face Shape
* Skin Colour 
* Eyes and EyeBrows
* Ear Shape
* Nose Shape 
* Facial Hair

The attributes of the base layer are fixed and cannot be changed once the base layer is minted. 

NOTE: The visual appearance of some attributes (such as hair colour and eye colour) can be altered by drops such as hair dye and eye lens respectively. 

## 🎩 Drops 

Drops are tradeable add-ons that can augment the appearance and functionality of the base layer. For example, a drop of caps and beanies will only alter the appearance of the avatar but a drop of dance moves will allow your avatar to perform a special dance move.

Drops are treated as separate NFTs and augment 3moji with the help of the Meta Blocks protocol. 

The drops for 3moji can be created by third party artists, designers and brands as well as 3moji itself. All the revenue generated from mints and secondary trades goes straight to the creator of the drop. 3moji does not get any part of the revenue. The technicalities such as the number, availability and features of a drop are decided by the creator of the drop. 

For example, a fashion brand can create a pair of sunglasses for 3moji and sell 10000 of them in a drop. The following week, the same brand can release an ultra-exclusive hat that’s only available to the owners of the sunglasses.  

## 🤝 Markets 

All first-party 3moji drops are sold on the 3moji Marketplace powered by Meta Blocks. Third party artists can choose to sell their 3moji drops via the 3moji Marketplace or a third party marketplace. 

3moji’s drops are a complete NFT on their own and augment the base layer via the Meta Blocks protocol. Hence, 3moji drops are tradeable on the existing secondary markets such as Solan Art, Magic Eden, Alpha Art, Solsea, FTX, Exchange Art, etc, without any specialized tooling.

## 👩🪄👸 Augmentation and Rendering

Once you’ve minted a base layer and minted/purchased/acquired a drop, you’ll need to send both of them to Meta Blocks Smart Contract in order to augment the base layer. 

The Meta Blocks rendering system will produce all the possible combinations of renders based on your base layer and the drops sent to the contract.

## 🛠 Use Cases

### PFP

The go-to use case of 3moji is profile pictures. Unlike traditional NFTs where you’re stuck with the traits you have, 3moji allows you to upgrade and evolve your PFP with you over time. The identifying base layer does not change, so your 3moji avatar will be recognizable as YOUR 3moji, but you can upgrade its style over time. 

### Stickers

3moji allows you to own your virtual expression and express yourself in your day-to-day communications with a variety of stickers generated from the NFTs you own. Everyone’s 3moji stickers will be unique based on the combination of the base layer and the currently equipped drops. 

We've derived expression from the top 30 most used emojis and these stickers are available for all 3moji users.

Some stickers are locked with associated drops, for example the following sticker only unlocks if you have a wizard hat.

These stickers can be used on platforms like Telegram, Whatsapp, Chrome and more. Hence this brings real-world utility to your digital assets.  

### Live Avatars 

3moji 3D models can be used as avatars in partner Metaverse and games as well as to record or present oneself on video calls. The motion and the facial expressions of the avatar are synced with that of the user using the camera.
