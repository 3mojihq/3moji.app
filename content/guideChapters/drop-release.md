Accessories (known as “Drops”) can be minted, bought and traded by the users to augment their NFT. 

Each drop works like a traditional NFT collection, wherein the creator of the drop decides price, availability and attributes of a drop. 

For example:

1. An artist could release a collection of 1000 cap NFTs with three different traits, the bill, colour and logo. Buyers can then mint the cap and get a combination of traits at random. 
2. An artist could release a collection of 1000 cap NFTs that look exactly the same. This is particularly useful for offline fashion brands that wish to release their apparel in for 3moji.  

Once you possess a drop, you'll need to send it to the Meta Blocks Smart Contract to augment the base layer and generate a Meta NFT. A Meta NFT is a rendered NFT created from the NFTs that have been deposited in the Meta Blocks smart contract. 

3moji drops cannot be traded while being used, that is when they are locked in the Meta Blocks Smart Contract.
