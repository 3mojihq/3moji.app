Accessories (known as “Drops”) can be minted, bought and traded by the users to augment their NFT. 

Each drop works like a traditional NFT collection, wherein the creator of the drop decides the price, availability and attributes of a drop. 

For example:

1. An artist could release a collection of 1000 cap NFTs with three different traits, the bill, colour and logo. Buyers can then mint the cap and get a combination of traits at random. 
2. An artist could release a collection of 1000 cap NFTs that look exactly the same. This is particularly useful for offline fashion brands that wish to release their apparel in for 3moji.  

Once you own a drop, you'll need to send it to the Meta Blocks Smart Contract to augment the base layer and generate a Meta NFT. A Meta NFT is a rendered NFT created from the NFTs that have been deposited in the Meta Blocks smart contract. 

> Each time you deposit or withdraw and NFT to a universe, the meta NFT is modified to reflect the state of the universe.
>
> You might loose your NFTs stored in the escrow if you transfer this meta NFT to someone. (TODO: Confirm the implications).
>
> This meta NFT lets you visualise the combination of assets stored in the universe, right in your wallet. It also acts as an on-chain index, and removes the dependancy on the Indexing service, to read a user's state in a universe.

3moji drops cannot be traded while being used, that is when they are locked in the Meta Blocks Smart Contract.
