If you‚Äôre an established NFT project (post-mint phase), you can integrate your project into the 3moji universe to extend the utility and interoperability of your project. Holders of your NFTs can lock the original NFT in the Meta Blocks smart contract and receive a 3moji compatible version of the said NFT.¬†

For example, holders of the Degen Ape Academy could lock their ape to receive a beanie with the corresponding attributes of that ape. In the following example, a user locked their Degen Ape and received a beanie with its corresponding traits.

A user can now extend the utility of their ape to customizable NFTs, stickers, video chats and a controllable character within compatible and partner metaverses and games.¬†

‚ö† 3moji is not associated with Degen Apes. This example is just for illustrative purposes. Currently, there are no integrations or partnerships between Degen Ape Academy and 3moji.¬†¬†

The NFT project is responsible for creating the 3moji compatible versions of their NFTs which will be held by their users, which opens the horizons of creativity for the artists. The 3moji compatible versions of the original NFTs can be freely traded as well, wherein the ownership of the original NFT will be entitled to the user who holds the 3moji compatible version.¬†

Building on 3moji also allows existing projects to reuse and expand their community, stay on top of current trends and easily collab with other projects.
